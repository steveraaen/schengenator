Since when detrmining eligibility, one must go back 180 days, 
the process begins by asking if the user has been to Europe since
a date that is 180 days before the current date. If the answer is yes,
the app navigates to a calendar component that displays a block calendar
that includes all months between the start date and current day.

User then touches the dates s/he was in Europe.  the counter increments by 1, and the date becomes highlighted.
